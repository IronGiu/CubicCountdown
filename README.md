**What's this?** <br>
A simple and easy to use plugin with which it is possible to configure cubes, which in turn can start a countdown after being filled with blocks (as well as other actions). The countdown as well as the actions can be fully customized and it even includes an API to customize the plugin perfectly for yourself (Java knowledge required)

**Compatible Software:** TikFinity <br>
**Compatible Plugins:** DelayedTNT

**Installation:** <br>
**1.** Download the newest version from Releases <br>
**2.** Drag and Drop the newest release from the Downloads to the plugins folder of your Minecraft-Server <br>
**3.** Start/Restart your server <br>
**4.** You're ready to go!<br>

**How to use the plugin?:** <br>
Setup is very easy! Once the plugin is installed, run the **/cc setup** command and follow the plugin's instructions

**Commands:**
<br> /cubiccountdown **setup** - Starts the setup process in which 5 simple steps must be followed to add a cube (MAIN COMMAND)
<br> /cubiccountdown **cancel MAPNAME** - Cancels a running countdown of a map
<br> /cubiccountdown **delete MAPNAME** - Deletes an existing cube (which was created before with /cc setup)
<br> /cubiccountdown **reload** - Reloads the Config and data files
<br> /cubiccountdown **help** - Opens the help menu

**QAndA:**
<br>**Q:** *Help! The plugin says that I do not have the permission to use the plugin commands!*
<br>**A:** To solve this issue just open your server console and type the following command into the console: **op yourminecraftusername**
<br>**Q:** *What is the first and second edge?*
<br>**A:** This means the bottom corner and the diagonal top corner. The order doesn't matter
<br>**Q:** *How can I change the title formatting, the sound effects,... of the plugin?*
<br>**A:** This specific settings cannot be changed ingame. To change it, open your minecraft server folder, open the plugins and after that the CubicCountdown folder. If you open the config.yml you'll see many settings. Change it to your preferences, save the file, go back ingame and type **/cc reload** into the chat.

**API:**
<br> Currently there's no maven or gradle respository out yet. To get access to the api you need to add the JAR file from the releases tab to the build path of your project (in your IDEA). After that you're able to proceed:
